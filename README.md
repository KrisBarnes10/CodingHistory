# CodingHistory

This directory are example projects of code I have created individually or as part of a team.

AzureJiraCode.py
This python code was created as part of an intern project during my summer internship at Trimble.
The main goal of this project was to query Jira cases by user input and to download and parse the Azure repo 
then find the matching cases by the Jira ID number. The steps to this tool are as follows:
    Query Jira cases by uses input and the results can be displayed in a table.
    The results can be exported to a CSV format.
    Get the Azure commits and display them in a table.
    Optionally, add branch and tag information.
    The Azure results can be export to a csv format.
    Find the Jira and Azure matches by the Jira ID number.
    The matched results can be exported to a csv file.

RasperberryPiDoorbellProjectManagementClass.zip
For a group project management class, we created a doorbell that operated off of raspberry pi. This folder contains the code that we used plus a video of the finished doorbell.
